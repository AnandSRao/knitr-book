# Dynamic Report Generation with R

This book is mainly about the R package **knitr**, which is on CRAN (<http://cran.r-project.org/package=knitr>) and has detailed documentation and examples (<http://yihui.name/knitr/>). I think it may be a good idea to organize these materials in a better form, and explain more details about **knitr** which are not covered in the online documentation. It is also a good opportunity to [eat my own dog food](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) and see how **knitr** performs in the real world.

## Ebook

I do not know if this repository can grow into a real book in the end. At the moment, it can be easily turned into an ebook with [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), which you can read on iPad or Kindle or other electronic book readers.
